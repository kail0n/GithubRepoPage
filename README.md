## GithubRepoPage

This project is a GitHub repo tracker, so we can get an overview of our work without visiting the site itself.

## Requirements

- Your app should make use of React
- Your repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
- After submitting their username, use the GitHub API to retrieve that user's list of repos
- When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc.

NB: This usage of the GitHub API does not require authentication
